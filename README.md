# nsfw-reddit
So this repo helps you determine if a sub or postis nsfw or not.        
Interesting things to note: the objects are pretty strange, `over18` for the subreddit and `over_18` for post.        
to get subreddit details i played around with the about and adding .json behind gave me the things i needed. or i could have just went node-fetch by plain text and `.search()`     
Anyhow I'm leaving this here because of the lack of documentation.

this is how you               
find if a subreddit is nsfw         
find if a reddit post is nsfw     

For some reason documentation on this topic is either scarce or obscure. After finding out this method by trial and error, I ended up also finding out that someone on quora. Which btw was on page 4 of google for some reason.          

Don't actually use this code directly as it is badly written and please come up with better variable names than just banana.
