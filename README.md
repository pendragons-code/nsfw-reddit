# nsfw-reddit
So this repo helps you determine if a sub or post is nsfw or not.        
Interesting things to note: the objects are pretty strange, `over18` for the subreddit and `over_18` for post.        
to get subreddit details i played around with the about and adding .json behind gave me the things i needed. or i could have just went node-fetch by plain text and `.search()`     
Anyhow I'm leaving this here because of the lack of documentation. Existing numbers of documentation on the nsfw topic is not exactly impossible to find, but there are people who could not figure things out, because let me remind you, [this](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) is the reddit docs.

this is how you               
find if a subreddit is nsfw with nodejs         
find if a reddit post is nsfw with nodejs     

` ^^ adding this thing here so people may find it on google.`      



For some reason documentation on this topic is either scarce or obscure. After finding out this method by trial and error, I ended up also finding out that someone on quora. Which btw was on page 4 of google for some reason.          

Don't actually use this code directly as it is badly written and please come up with better variable names than just banana.



**also r/gonewild is nsfw** [DON't GO THERE PLS], i came across it when i was making this filter for my bot and popped into literally the first discord server on my list and asked? `any nsfw subreddit? for research purposes`. i also sent this repo url there to clear up some misunderstandings.
